  <WoW_Animal_Manasaber.description>Manasabers, are a type of saber cat on the Broken Isles, mainly Suramar, that have been altered by the nightborne or by ley-line exposure. They are purple and covered with runes. They are usually the favored mounts and animal companions of the nightborne. It is currently not known whether mana sabers are dependent on external sources of mana like the nightborne are. It is possible that mana sabers in the wild can only be sustained through passive ley-line exposure. It is also possible that they 'puncture and leak energy' from their targets to feed on.</WoW_Animal_Manasaber.description>
