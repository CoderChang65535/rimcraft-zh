  <WoW_Animal_Kodo.description>Kodo are massive reptiles with hardly visible scales and thick leathery skin that ranges in color from sandy brown to black. Most kodo have a large horn that sprouts from their nose, and some are even covered in woolly hair. Kodo range across central Kalimdor, but are particularly prevalent in Mulgore, after they were brought there by tauren during the Third War, where the rolling grassy plains are particularly suited to their omnivorous nature. Wild kodo are normally herbivorous, however, and will not attack unless threatened.</WoW_Animal_Kodo.description>
