  <WoW_Gnome.description>The gnomes (collectively referred to as gnomanity or gnomekind) are a race of diminutive and highly intelligent humanoids, known for their mastery of technology. They were originally descended from mechagnomes, metallic titan-forged, who were afflicted with the Curse of Flesh. Gnomes are a race of ambitious folk that celebrate creativity and craft and whose lives are validated by a masterful command of the scientific laws of the universe. This outlook on life makes them feel that to be pitied is unbearable, even insulting, though they know their allies do not do this intentionally. They have been more of a race of scholars throughout their history, generally focused on escaping and avoiding conflict, being also known to offset their lack of physical strength with ingenuity and daring.</WoW_Gnome.description>
