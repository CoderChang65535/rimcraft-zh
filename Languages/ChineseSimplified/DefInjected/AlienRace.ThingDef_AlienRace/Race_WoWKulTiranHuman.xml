  <WoW_KulTiranHuman.description>The humans of Kul Tiras can have a more robust and rugged look than their continental brethren. Their clothing is made for harsh weather, with high collars. They have a pride and connection with ships, and as such their buildings are inspired by them. The Kul Tiran Outriggers fight and hunt the monsters of the Great Sea around their island.</WoW_KulTiranHuman.description>
