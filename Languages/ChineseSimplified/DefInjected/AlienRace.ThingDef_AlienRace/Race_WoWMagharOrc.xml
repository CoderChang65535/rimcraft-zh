  <WoW_MagharOrc.description>The Mag'har orcs ("uncorrupted" in Orcish), also known as "brown orcs", are the orcs that escaped the corruption of the Burning Legion. On Draenor, they were a result of isolation from the Horde due to being quarantined in Garadar. They have a noble shamanistic tradition cultivating a mighty tribal society that was centered around survival, regulating themselves through ritualized combat and personal honor.</WoW_MagharOrc.description>
