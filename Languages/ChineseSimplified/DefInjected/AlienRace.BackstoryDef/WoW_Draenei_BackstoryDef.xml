  <WoW_Draenei_Backstory_Child_1.baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] started life as an eredar on their home planet of Argus. After two of their greatest leaders were corrupted by demons of the Burning Legion [PAWN_pronoun] fled with like-minded refugees to the highest mountain on the longest day of the year. There the naaru K'ure granted them a chance to leave via the inter-dimensional ship Genedar and the refugees renamed themselves the draenei, the "exiled ones".</WoW_Draenei_Backstory_Child_1.baseDescription>

[PAWN_nameDef] prepares for the day by training rigorously with various weaponry and studying the practices of the Light and the naaru. Granted, [PAWN_nameDef] has been doing this ever since the naaru first revealed themselves. Regardless, [PAWN_pronoun] continues to do so. Even if [PAWN_nameDef] never joins the Army of the Light [PAWN_pronoun] has proven to be an efficient soldier.</WoW_Draenei_Backstory_Child_2.baseDescription>

  <WoW_Draenei_Backstory_Child_3.title>Exodar orphan</WoW_Draenei_Backstory_Child_3.title>
  <WoW_Draenei_Backstory_Child_3.baseDescription>After their arrivals on Azeroth, the draenei had left behind many of their people including the parents of [PAWN_nameDef] who couldn't join the ship on time. [PAWN_nameDef] left alone, was quickly put on an orphanage with many others, but considering the situation the draenei were in, they received just a basic education, and each one of them made their own path on Azeroth.</WoW_Draenei_Backstory_Child_3.baseDescription>

  <WoW_Draenei_Backstory_Adult_2.baseDescription>Talbuk venison is a favoured food of the draenei. [PAWN_nameDef] spent many days hunting the majestic beasts across the plains of Argus, until the Burning Legion arrived. [PAWN_pronoun] then ensured that several herds of talbuk were brought aboard the Genedar during their flight from Argus and watched as they made a home for themselves on Draenor. [PAWN_nameDef] continues to hunt them whichever planet they end up on, though now with added respect for their numbers.</WoW_Draenei_Backstory_Adult_2.baseDescription>

  <WoW_Draenei_Backstory_Adult_3.title>Vindicator</WoW_Draenei_Backstory_Adult_3.title>
  <WoW_Draenei_Backstory_Adult_3.baseDescription>It is unclear what the true purpose of a draenei vindicator is, with many believing it to be the draenic version of the paladin. Despite this many vindicators do not, or choose not to, use Light magic and some have even been named "dark vindicators", going completely against these assumptions. Others have since likened the term to be more similar to a courtroom judge. Whatever the real meaning behind the title may be, [PAWN_nameDef] is very familiar with both words and weaponry. Best tread lightly around [PAWN_pronoun].</WoW_Draenei_Backstory_Adult_3.baseDescription>

After an injured draenei scout was saved by an elekk from hostile podlings, the draenei began domesticating and training the elephant-like creatures as hardy mounts with [PAWN_nameDef] at the forefront. When the draenei were made to flee Draenor [PAWN_nameDef] ensured a large herd of elekk came with them.</WoW_Draenei_Backstory_Adult_4.baseDescription>

[PAWN_nameDef]'s job was to destroy the Legion's ammunition by dropping bombs from the back of [PAWN_possessive] aether ray as they flew over the camps.

  <WoW_Draenei_Backstory_Adult_7.baseDescription>Artificers excelled in working with the arkonite crystals used to adorn weapons and armour and often as make-shift power and data storage. However, the technology available now is only a shadow of what the draenei had on Argus. Despite this, [PAWN_nameDef] still makes the best use of what is available to [PAWN_pronoun] in attempt to keep the old practices alive. Now and again non-draenei may find crystals and gems embedded in what they'd otherwise consider everyday objects.</WoW_Draenei_Backstory_Adult_7.baseDescription>

  <WoW_Draenei_Backstory_Adult_10.baseDescription>After shepherding them in their flight from Argus, the naaru K'ure blessed the draenei with Light-given knowledge and power. Deeply affected by the naaru's words, the draenei vowed to honour the Light and uphold the naaru's altruistic ideals. [PAWN_nameDef] is one of many who chose to become a priest of this new order. [PAWN_pronoun] often repeats K'ure's words to anyone who would listen, that other forces in the cosmos would also stand against the Burning Legion and, one day, the naaru would forge them all into a single, unstoppable Army of the Light.</WoW_Draenei_Backstory_Adult_10.baseDescription>

Because of the attacks by the blood knight army serving under the late Prince Kael'thas [PAWN_nameDef] despises blood elves with a passion.

[PAWN_pronoun] acts as a scout, gathering valuable intelligence about the lay of the land to use to [PAWN_possessive] advantage. Early on, [PAWN_nameDef] learned from the Laughing Skull orc clan that podlings hate fire. It's possible some orcs and draenei still respect one another.</DraeneiAdult12.baseDescription>
