  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Child_1.title>Stablehand</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Child_1.title>
  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Child_1.baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] often helped out at the stable grounds to take care of the horses kept there. [PAWN_pronoun] would groom, feed and water each individual animal and would help move them between paddocks. However [PAWN_nameDef] refused to muck out the stables, instead bribing other children to do it in return for favours [PAWN_pronoun] may or may not have followed up on.</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Child_1.baseDescription>

  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Child_2.title>War Survivor</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Child_2.title>
  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Child_2.baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] was born in Lordaeron during the Second War as orcs made their way through the human lands. [PAWN_nameDef] and [PAWN_possessive] family fled to Gilneas in hopes of safety only to find themselves locked behind stone walls and beset upon by ravenous monsters. They survived, but not how they'd imagined they would.</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Child_2.baseDescription>

  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Child_3.title>Gilnean Lordling</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Child_3.title>
  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Child_3.baseDescription>Growing up in an impressive Gilnean manor [PAWN_nameDef] was never taught proper technical skills and became accustomed to grovelling lower class citizens doing [PAWN_possessive] work for [PAWN_pronoun]. Listening in on [PAWN_possessive] parent's meetings did however teach [PAWN_pronoun] the art of social manipulation.</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Child_3.baseDescription>

  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Child_4.title>Newspaper Hawker</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Child_4.title>
  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Child_4.baseDescription>Every day [PAWN_nameDef] would grab as many newspapers from the printers as [PAWN_pronoun] could carry and stand at [PAWN_possessive] favourite corner, shouting loudly and calling to passers-by in hopes of making a sale. [PAWN_nameDef] often got beaten up by other kids who thought [PAWN_pronoun] was boring and stupid for shouting so much. [PAWN_pronoun] fought back by fashioning clubs out of rolled up paper.</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Child_4.baseDescription>

  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Child_5.title>Bookworm</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Child_5.title>
  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Child_5.baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] could always be found with [PAWN_possessive] nose in a book. It was rare to see [PAWN_nameDef] outside unless [PAWN_pronoun] was headed to the local library. If it had words, [PAWN_pronoun] would be reading it. [PAWN_pronoun] was oblivious to everything when reading. [PAWN_pronoun] preferred this and even found some interesting facts along the way.</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Child_5.baseDescription>

  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_1.title>Gilnean Militia</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_1.title>
  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_1.baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] was part of the Gilnean military serving king Genn Greymane. [PAWN_pronoun] fought alongside few other Gilneans during the Second War against the invading orcs where [PAWN_pronoun] was ordered to only kill the greenskins and not bother capturing them. After the war the militia was redirected to defend the Greymane Wall when it was built and as such was one of the first to be turned by the worgen after they were summoned.</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_1.baseDescription>

  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_2.title>Turned Civilian</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_2.title>
  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_2.baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] was just a run-of-the-mill, uninteresting, everyday citizen of Gilneas. Nothing remarkable. [PAWN_pronoun] went to work, took care of [PAWN_possessive] family, all the basic stuff. So of course [PAWN_pronoun] got bitten on the way to work one morning. Now [PAWN_nameDef] is just a run-of-the-mill, slightly interesting, everyday worgen. No big deal.</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_2.baseDescription>

  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_3.title>Rancher</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_3.title>
  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_3.baseDescription>Despite what outsiders may have thought of [PAWN_nameDef]'s homeland Gilneas was good grounds for mountain horses. [PAWN_nameDef] regularly wrangled the horses, having to take great care around the local ettin looking to eat them, and trained them for use as mounts and pulling carriages. To this day people are furious that the favoured mount of Gilneas is yet another horse and not some funky wolf-like boar creature, something [PAWN_nameDef] really doesn't understand.</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_3.baseDescription>

  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_4.title>Scatterbrained Elder</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_4.title>
  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_4.baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] is senile through and through. Or is [PAWN_pronoun]? It's hard to tell if it's all a ruse or not. Whenever a situation of grave importance occurs [PAWN_nameDef]'s priority is keeping up a good appearance, finding [PAWN_possessive] favourite book and the safety of [PAWN_possessive] pet cat, Chance. And yet, [PAWN_nameDef] was one of the first able to control the transformation between worgen and human. No one knows when or how [PAWN_nameDef] Turned as [PAWN_pronoun] never seems to realise what happened. That or [PAWN_pronoun] is very good at hiding things.</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_4.baseDescription>

  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_5.title>Watchman</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_5.title>
  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_5.baseDescription>During the curfew instated by King Greymane a few chosen watchmen prowled the streets at night. [PAWN_nameDef] was one such watchman, patrolling the city for signs of robbers and burglary. Even those with high social status weren't free from [PAWN_possessive] keen eyes and [PAWN_pronoun] gave warning to many lords and ladies by claiming 'it is impossible to distinguish a lord from another man by the outside of a coach, especially at unreasonable times'. Somehow [PAWN_nameDef] never got in trouble for it.</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_5.baseDescription>

  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_6.title>Gilnean Aristocrat</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_6.title>
  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_6.baseDescription>Hosting and attending parties and commanding those beneath [PAWN_pronoun] did not require [PAWN_nameDef] to learn how to utilise a tool or work in any manual fashion. However [PAWN_nameDef] greatly opposed the king's tactic to flee and hide from the encroaching worgen and was one of the first to take up arms against the beasts. Ultimately [PAWN_pronoun] failed but has since decided that being a worgen isn't quite so bad after all.</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_6.baseDescription>

  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_7.title>Wolfpack Member</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_7.title>
  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_7.baseDescription>The Wolfpack is a small group of able worgen seeking revenge for their lost homeland. [PAWN_nameDef] joins [PAWN_possessive] comrades in leading expeditions against the Horde, providing a hit list of known targets to be taken down. During the travel [PAWN_nameDef] is content to nap but is just as eager to begin a hunt once arriving at [PAWN_possessive] destination.</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_7.baseDescription>

  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_8.title>Chemist</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_8.title>
  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_8.baseDescription>The original recipe for the cure that allowed worgen to retain their sanity was lost during the fall of Gilneas. [PAWN_nameDef] has taken charge of remaking this recipe before something dreadful happens, though no one yet shows sign of falling back into mindless rage. The only problem is figuring out the ingredients. All [PAWN_pronoun] knows is that mandrake essence was involved and so [PAWN_pronoun] spends much of [PAWN_possessive] time experimenting with various herbs. Maybe wolfsbane would work?</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_8.baseDescription>

  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_9.title>Huntsman</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_9.title>
  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_9.baseDescription>Some hunters hunt for sport. Others hunt out of necessity. [PAWN_nameDef] does both as the time and situation demands. While [PAWN_possessive] house was once full of mounted fox tails and deer antlers [PAWN_nameDef] sold the rest of the animals to butchers and leather workers to be used fully. In [PAWN_possessive] downtime [PAWN_nameDef] also enjoyed cooking what scraps [PAWN_pronoun] kept to feed [PAWN_possessive] family.</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_9.baseDescription>

  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_10.title>Harvest-Witch</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_10.title>
  <WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_10.baseDescription>Thanks to the relative isolation of Gilneas the old way of the harvest-witch was able to flourish, while in other parts of the world it was pushed aside in favour of the Light and Arcane. [PAWN_nameDef] is an able user of the druid-like power over plant life and offers [PAWN_possessive] service during times of drought and famine. Some claim harvest-witches capable of turning into animals. If it is true [PAWN_nameDef] is incapable of such. Harvest-witches aren't true druids after all.</WoW_Worgen_Backstory_Adult_10.baseDescription>
